# movies-api-in-golang
In this repository we have built a complete CRUD REST API for movies using golang that exposes GET, POST, DELETE and PUT endpoints that will subsequently allow 
you to perform the full range of CRUD operations.

In order to keep this simple and focus on the basic concepts, we won’t be interacting with any backend database technologies to store
the articles that we’ll be playing with. However, we will be writing this REST API in such a way that it will be easy to update the  
functions we will be defining so that they make subsequent calls to a database to perform any necessary CRUD operations 

## Instructions to run code:
-  Clone the repo
     * git clone
  
 - Run the app using
     * in powershell use specific file name to run the project
     * command go run main.go

 - Use POSTMAN for Testing
    * Test all routes,endpoints,operations(CRUD) using POSTMAN
